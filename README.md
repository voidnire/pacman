# 🟡 Pac-Man - Classic Game Developed with HTML and JavaScript
<h2>🎯 Description</h2>
This project is a simple and fun version of Pac-Man, where you control the iconic yellow character who must eat all the dots and avoid the ghosts.

The game was developed as a practical exercise to improve my JavaScript skills and DOM manipulation.
